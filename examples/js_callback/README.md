# Js Callback Example

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/website?label=demo&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexamples.yew.rs%2Fjs_callback)](https://examples.yew.rs/js_callback)

## Concepts

The example uses wasm-bindgen to import functionality from Javascript.
To learn more about the subject, refer to ["The `wasm-binden` Guide"](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/examples/import-js.html).

## Improvements

This example is a purely technical demonstration and lacks an actual purpose.
The best way to improve this example would be to incorporate this concept into a small application.

- Do something more complex in the Javascript code to demonstrate more of `wasm-bindgen`'s capabilities.
- Show a loading indicator while waiting after pressing "Get the payload later!".
- Improve the presentation of the example with CSS.
