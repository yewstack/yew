<h2>Inline HTML with SVG</h2>
<p>
  The whole contents of this page is stored as a constant HTML string in the
  Rust source code. The code queries the DOM, creates a new element, and applies
  this snippet of HTML to the element's innerHTML.
</p>
<p>
  If you look at your browser's console you can see the DOM element (logged to
  the console).
</p>
<svg height="250" width="500">
  <polygon
    points="220,10 300,210 170,250 123,234"
    style="fill: lime; stroke: purple; stroke-width: 1"
  />
  Sorry, your browser does not support inline SVG.
