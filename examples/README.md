# Yew Examples

## How to run

The examples are built with [trunk](https://github.com/thedodd/trunk).
You can install it with the following command:

```bash
# at some point in the future, trunk will automatically download wasm-bindgen
cargo install trunk wasm-bindgen-cli
```

Running an example is as easy as running a single command:

```bash
# move into the directory of the example you want to run
# In this case it's the todomvc example
cd examples/todomvc

# build and serve the example
trunk serve --release
```

We're also publicly hosting the examples at `https://examples.yew.rs/<EXAMPLE>`.
As an example, check out the TodoMVC example here: <https://examples.yew.rs/todomvc>

## Next steps

Have a look at Yew's [starter templates](https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/starter-templates) when starting a project using Yew – they can significantly simplify things.

## Help out

If one of the examples catches your interest, look for the "improvements" section in its `README` file.
Most examples list a few ideas for how to improve them.
Consider starting with those but don't hesitate to improve an example in other ways either.

One problem that currently plagues most examples is the lack of styling.
Please help us make the examples look as flashy as possible!
