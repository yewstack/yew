# Yew Examples

In order to run the examples, we provide the `run_example.sh` script.
This script takes care of compiling the example and runs a web server for you.
All that's left is for you to play around with the examples :).

> **A note for Windows users:**<br>
> Depending on how you installed `git` you will already have a bash emulator at your disposal. This allows you to run the `run_example.sh` script (and any other bash script) normally.<br>
> See <https://gitforwindows.org/#bash> for more information.
>
> We're always trying to improve the developer experience for developers across all platforms.
> There's an ongoing effort to replace the bash scripts with a Rust command line tool ([#1418](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/issues/1418)).
> If at any point you encounter an issue, don't hesitate to ask a question or open an issue.

## Dependencies

Before we can run the examples we need to get a few things ready.

Some examples currently use `wasm-bindgen` and others use `wasm-pack`.
You can install them both using the following command:

```bash
cargo install wasm-pack wasm-bindgen-cli
```

### Optional dependencies

We've written a small web server which you can use to serve the built examples. In order to
use it, you'll need to have installed Python (3.6 or greater).
You can also use a different web server, provided that it can serve static files from a directory.

> **Note:**<br>
> Some examples don't have an `index.html` file in their static directory.
> The python web server handles this by serving a default index file.
> If you aren't using it, you will need to create the index file manually.

One alternative to the built-in web server there is an extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) called [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
This extension is used to serve static files.
To do so, open the `index.html` file in the static directory of the example you wish to run and press "Open with Live Server" in the context menu.

## Run an example

```bash
# download the source code.
git clone https://github.com/yewstack/yew.git

# move into the examples folder
cd yew/examples

# run the "todomvc" example
./run_example.sh todomvc
```

## Script options

The general structure of the command looks like this:<br>
`./run_example.sh <example> [OPTIONS]`

`<example>` is the name of the example (i.e. the name of the directory).

The following table describes all possible options:

| Option                   | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--debug`<br>`--release` | Specifies which profile to use for `cargo build`. Defaults to `--debug`.                                            |
| `--build-only`           | Disables the built-in server.<br>Use this if you don't have Python installed or if you want to use your own server. |

## Next steps

Have a look at Yew's [starter templates](https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/starter-templates) when starting a project using Yew – they can significantly simplify things.
