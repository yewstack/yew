# Memory Game Example

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/website?label=demo&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexamples.yew.rs%2Ffunction_memory_game)](https://examples.yew.rs/function_memory_game)

This is an implementation of [Memory Game](https://github.com/bradlygreen/Memory-Game) for Yew using function components and hooks.

## Concepts

- Uses [`function_components`](https://yew.rs/docs/next/concepts/function-components)
- Uses [`gloo::storage`](https://docs.rs/gloo-storage/0.2.0/gloo_storage/index.html) to persist the state
- Uses [`gloo::timers`](https://docs.rs/gloo-timers/0.2.2/gloo_timers/index.html) to schedule asynchronous callback
