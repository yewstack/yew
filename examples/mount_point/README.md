# Mount Point Example

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/website?label=demo&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexamples.yew.rs%2Fmount_point)](https://examples.yew.rs/mount_point)

This example displays a green square followed by an input box and a field
which contains the contents of the input box in reverse.

## Concepts

- Using the Javascript APIs with web-sys
- Taking control of the mounting process which is usually handled by `yew::start_app`

## Improvements

This example is very similar to [`two_apps`](../two_apps).
The two should be merged into a single example.

## Running

Run this application with the trunk development server:

```bash
trunk serve --open
```
