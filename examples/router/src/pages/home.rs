                            A yew is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, growing 10 to 20 metres tall, with a trunk up to 2 metres in diameter.
                            The bark is thin, scaly brown, coming off in small flakes aligned with the stem.
                            The leaves are flat, dark green, 1 to 4 centimetres long and 2 to 3 millimetres broad, arranged spirally on the stem,
                            but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem,
                            except on erect leading shoots where the spiral arrangement is more obvious.
                            The leaves are poisonous.
