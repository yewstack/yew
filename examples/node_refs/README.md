# Node Refs Example

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/website?label=demo&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexamples.yew.rs%2Fnode_refs)](https://examples.yew.rs/node_refs)

This example shows two input fields which are automatically focused when hovered over.

## Concepts

The example uses [Refs](https://yew.rs/docs/en/concepts/components/refs/) to
manipulate the underlying DOM element directly.

## Improvements

- Use CSS to improve the presentation of the example
- Expand this to a fully fledged form with input validation etc.
