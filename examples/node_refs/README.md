# Node Refs Example

This example shows two input fields which are automatically focused when hovered over.

## Concepts

The example uses [Refs](https://yew.rs/docs/en/concepts/components/refs/) to
manipulate the underlying DOM element directly.

## Improvements

- Use CSS to improve the presentation of the example
- Expand this to a fully fledged form with input validation etc.
