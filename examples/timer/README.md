# Timer Example

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/website?label=demo&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexamples.yew.rs%2Ftimer)](https://examples.yew.rs/timer)

This is a technical demonstration for how to use timeouts and intervals.

## Concepts

The example mainly demonstrates the use of [`gloo_timer`](https://docs.rs/gloo-timers/ ) and 
[`gloo_console_timer`](https://docs.rs/gloo-console/latest/gloo_console/struct.Timer.html) but also makes use of some 
more advanced web console features.

## Improvements

- Apply the concept to something more fun than just a dry technical demonstration

## Running

Run this application with the trunk development server:

```bash
trunk serve --open
```
