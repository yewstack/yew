# Timer Example

[![Demo](https://img.shields.io/website?label=demo&url=https%3A%2F%2Fexamples.yew.rs%2Ftimer_functional)](https://examples.yew.rs/timer_functional)

This is a technical demonstration for how to use timeouts and intervals.

## Concepts

The example mainly demonstrates the use of [`gloo_timer`](https://docs.rs/gloo-timers/ ) but does so using only [`function components`](https://yew.rs/docs/concepts/function-components).

## Running

Run a debug version of this application:

```bash
trunk serve --open
```
