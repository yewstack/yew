[The router on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/yew-router)

Routers in Single Page Applications (SPA) handle displaying different pages depending on what the URL is. 
Instead of the default behavior of requesting a different remote resource when a link is clicked, 
the router instead sets the URL locally to point to a valid route in your application. 
The router then detects this change and then decides what to render.

## Usage

The Router component. It takes in a callback and renders the HTML based on the returned value of the callback. It is usually placed
at the top of the application.

Routes are defined by an `enum` which derives `Routable`:
```rust
#[derive(Routable)]
enum Route {
    #[at("/")]
    Home,
    #[at("/secure")]
    Secure,
    #[not_found]
    #[at("/404")]
    NotFound,
}
```

The `Router` component takes the `Routable` enum as its type parameter, finds the first variant whose path matches the 
browser's current URL and passes it to the `render` callback. The callback then decides what to render. 
In case no path is matched, the router navigates to the path with `not_found` attribute. If no route is specified, 
nothing is rendered, and a message is logged to console stating that no route was matched.

`yew_router::current_route` is used to programmatically obtain the current route.
`yew_router::attach_route_listener` is used to attach a listener which is called every time route is changed. 

```rust
#[function_component(Main)]
fn app() -> Html {
    html! {
        <Router<Route> render=Router::render(switch) />
    }
}

fn switch(route: &Route) -> Html {
    match route {
        Route::Home => html! { <h1>{ "Home" }</h1> },
        Route::Secure => {
            let callback = Callback::from(|_| yew_router::push_route(Routes::Home));
            html! {
                <div>
                    <h1>{ "Secure" }</h1>
                    <button onclick=callback>{ "Go Home" }</button>
                </div>
            }
        },
        Route::NotFound => html! { <h1>{ "404" }</h1> },
    }
}
```

### Navigation

To navigate between pages, use either a `Link` component (which renders a `<a>` element) or the `yew_router::push_route` function.

### Query Parameters

#### Specifying query parameters when navigating

In order to specify query parameters when navigating to a new route, use `yew_router::push_route_with_query` function.
It uses `serde` to serialize the parameters into query string for the URL so any type that implements `Serialize` can be passed.
In its simplest form this is just a `HashMap` containing string pairs.

#### Obtaining query parameters for current route

`yew_router::parse_query` is used to obtain the query parameters.
It uses `serde` to deserialize the parameters from query string in the URL.
