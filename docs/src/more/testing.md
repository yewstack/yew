## Rust WebDriving

For programmatically driving UI integration testing using Rust, [https://crates.io/crates/fantoccini](https://crates.io/crates/fantoccini) is a recommended choice. It allows you to test your website by finding specific elements using CSS selectors, and then performing actions on them like inputting text, or clicking buttons, or waiting specific amounts of time for client code to execute \(eg, wait for a fetch request to finish and cause a UI change\).
