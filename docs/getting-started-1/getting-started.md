# Installation

### Rust

First, you'll need Rust. To install Rust and the `cargo` build tool, follow the official instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

### **Build Tooling**

[**`wasm-pack`**](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-pack/) is a tool developed by the Rust-Wasm working group and is the **recommended** tool for building your application. You can find the installation instructions here.

**\`\`**[**`cargo-web`**](https://github.com/koute/cargo-web) was the preferred web workflow tool before the introduction of `wasm-pack`. It is still the **quickest** way to get up and running and worth installing to run examples that haven't been migrated to support `wasm-pack` yet. Install it by running:

```bash
cargo install cargo-web
```
