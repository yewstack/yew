## wasm\_bingen\_test

The Rust WASM working group maintains a crate called [`wasm_bindgen_test`](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/wasm-bindgen-test/index.html) which allows you to run tests in a browser in similar fashion to how the built-in `#[test]` procedural macro works. More information is given in the [Rust WASM working group's documentation](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/wasm-bindgen-test/index.html) for this module.
