&lt;TODO&gt;

A proposal for integrated CSS support can be found here: 
[https://github.com/yewstack/yew/issues/533](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/issues/533)

This contains a lot of discussion about how to best integrate CSS support into Yew.

Currently, the approach we've adopted is to encourage developers to build a number of systems, before
adopting the most popular one.

The community are currently developing a number of projects to make it easy to add styles to 
projects. A few are given below:

* [yew_styles](https://github.com/spielrs/yew_styles) - A styling framework for Yew without any JavaScript dependencies.
* [yew-mdc](https://github.com/Follpvosten/yew-mdc) - Material Design Components.
* [muicss-yew](https://github.com/AlephAlpha/muicss-yew) - MUI CSS Components.
* [Yewtify](https://github.com/yewstack/yewtify) â€“ Implements the features provided by the Vuetify framework in Yew.
