<!-- Please only include one item in each issue! -->

This is about:
- [ ] A typo 
- [ ] Innaccurate/misleading documentation (e.g. technically incorrect advice)
- [ ] Undocumented code
- [ ] Outdated documentation
- [ ] Other

**Problem**
<!-- PLEASE INCLUDE A WAY TO LOCATE WHERE THE ISSUE IS, e.g.
 - A Github link to the text
 - The filename and line number
 - An excerpt from the docs that someone could use text search to locate
-->
<!-- What's wrong? -->

<!-- EXAMPLES FOR TYPOS: -->
<!-- e.g. There's a typo in the documentation about the `html!` macro. 
It's in the word on line 14 column 5 in file "..." Here's a link to the text on Github "https://github.com/..." -->
<!-- e.g. There's a typo in this sentence "..." on the webpage "https://yew.rs/..." -->

<!-- EXAMPLES FOR MISLEADING DOCS -->
<!-- e.g. The sentence "..." implies "..." but this is misleading because it might cause someone 
to think "..." which is wrong. -->

<!-- EXAMPLES FOR MISSING DOCS -->
<!-- e.g. There's no API documentation for the console service. -->
<!-- e.g. There's no documentation on yew.rs for the console service. -->

<!-- EXAMPLES FOR OUTDATED DOCS -->
<!-- e.g. The documentation about the `html!` macro was written for a previous version of Yew and should be updated. -->
