/// This hook is used to manually force a function component to re-render.
///
/// # Note
///
/// Often, using this hook means that you're doing something wrong.
/// Try to use more specialized hooks, such as [`use_state`] and [`use_reducer`].
/// This hook should only be used when your component depends on external state where you
/// can't subscribe to changes, or as a low-level primitive to enable such a subscription-based
/// approach.
///
/// # Use-case
///
/// Use this hook when wrapping an API that doesn't expose precise subscription events for fetched
/// data. You could then, at some point, invalidate your local cache of the fetched data and trigger
/// a re-render to let the normal render flow of components tell you again which data to fetch, and
/// repopulate the cache accordingly.
///
/// A large externally managed cache, such as a app-wide cache for GraphQL data
/// should not rerender every component whenever new data arrives, but only those where a query
/// changed.
///
/// If the state of your component is not shared, you should need to use this hook.
///
/// # Example
///
/// This example implements a silly, manually updated display of the current time. The component
/// is re-rendered every time the button is clicked. You should usually use a timeout and
/// `use_state` to automatically trigger a re-render every second without having to use this hook.
///
/// ```rust
/// use yew::prelude::*;
///
/// #[function_component]
/// fn ManuallyUpdatedDate() -> Html {
///     let trigger = use_force_update();
///     let onclick = use_state(move || Callback::from(move |_| trigger.force_update()));
///     let last_update = js_sys::Date::new_0().to_utc_string();
///     html! {
///         <div>
///             <button onclick={&*onclick}>{"Update now!"}</button>
///             <p>{"Last updated: "}{last_update}</p>
///         </div>
///     }
/// }
