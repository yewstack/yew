//! Compatibility between JavaScript Runtime and Native Runtimes.
//!
//! When designing components and libraries that works on both WebAssembly targets backed by
//! JavaScript Runtime and non-WebAssembly targets with Native Runtimes. Developers usually face
//! challenges that requires applying multiple feature flags throughout their application:
//!
//! 1. Select I/O and timers that works with the target runtime.
//! 2. Native Runtimes usually require `Send` futures and WebAssembly usually use `!Send`
//! primitives for better performance during Client-side Rendering.
//!
//! To alleviate these issues, Yew implements a single-threaded runtime that executes `?Send`
//! (`Send` or `!Send`) futures. When your application starts with `yew::Renderer` or is rendered by
//! `yew::ServerRenderer`, it is executed within the Yew runtime. On systems with multi-threading
//! support, it spawns multiple independent runtimes in a worker pool proportional to the CPU
//! core number. The renderer will randomly select a worker thread from the internal pool. All tasks
//! spawned with `spawn_local` in the application will run on the same thread as the
//! rendering thread the renderer has selected. When the renderer runs in a WebAssembly target, all
//! tasks will be scheduled on the main thread.
//!
//! This runtime is designed in favour of IO-bounded workload with similar runtime cost. It produces
//! better performance by pinning tasks to a single worker thread. However, this means that if a
//! worker thread is back-logged, other threads will not be able to "help" by running tasks
//! scheduled on the busy thread. When you have a CPU-bounded task where CPU time is significantly
//! more expensive than rendering tasks, it should be spawned with a dedicated thread or
//! `yew-agent` and communicates with the application using channels or agent bridges.
//!
//! # Runtime Backend
//!
//! Yew runtime is implemented with different runtimes depending on the target platform and can use
//! all features (timers / IO / task synchronisation) from the selected native runtime:
//!
//! - `wasm-bindgen-futures` (WebAssembly targets)
//! - `tokio` (non-WebAssembly targets)
//!
//! # Compatibility with other async runtimes
//!
//! Yew's ServerRenderer can also be executed in applications using other async runtimes(e.g.:
//! `async-std`). Rendering tasks will enter Yew runtime and be executed with `tokio`. When the
//! rendering task finishes, the result is returned to the original runtime. This process is
//! transparent to the future that executes the renderer. The Yew application still needs to use
//! `tokio`'s timer, IO and task synchronisation primitives.
