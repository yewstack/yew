## About

**Yew** is a modern Rust framework for creating multi-threaded front-end web apps with WebAssembly.

* Features a macro for declaring interactive HTML with Rust expressions. Developers who have experience using JSX in React should feel quite at home when using Yew.
* Achieves high performance by minimizing DOM API calls for each page render and by making it easy to offload processing to background web workers.
* Supports JavaScript interoperability, allowing developers to leverage NPM packages and integrate with existing JavaScript applications.

*Note: Yew is not (yet) production ready but is great for side projects and internal tools.*
