## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please email the maintainers at `maintainers@yew.rs`. Please do not create a Github issue

If you can, please include the following details:
* An MCVE (minimum complete verifiable example) – this is a short code snippet which demonstrates the error in the 
the simplest possible (or just a simple) way.
* Which versions of Yew the vulnerability is present in
* What effects the vulnerability has and how serious the vulnerability is
