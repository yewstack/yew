## Prioritization

The prioritization of upcoming features and focuses of the framework is determined by the community.
In Spring 2020, a developer survey was sent out to collect feedback on the direction of the project.
You can find the summary in the [Yew Wiki](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/wiki/Dev-Survey-%5BSpring-2020%5D).

:::note
Status of all major initiatives can be tracked on the Yew Github [project board](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/projects)
