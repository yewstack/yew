## Callbacks

Callbacks are used to communicate with services, agents, and parent components within Yew.
Internally their type is just `Fn` wrapped in `Rc` to allow them to be cloned.

They have an `emit` function that takes their `<IN>` type as an argument and converts that to a message expected by its destination. If a callback from a parent is provided in props to a child component, the child can call `emit` on the callback in its `update` lifecycle hook to send a message back to its parent. Closures or Functions provided as props inside the `html!` macro are automatically converted to Callbacks.

A simple use of a callback might look something like this:

```rust
use yew::{html, Component, Context, Html};

enum Msg {
    Clicked,
}

struct Comp;

impl Component for Comp {

    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_ctx: &Context<Self>) -> Self {
        Self
    }

    fn view(&self, ctx: &Context<Self>) -> Html {
        // highlight-next-line
        let onclick = ctx.link().callback(|_| Msg::Clicked);
        html! {
            // highlight-next-line
            <button {onclick}>{ "Click" }</button>
        }
    }
}
```

The function passed to `callback` must always take a parameter. For example, the `onclick` handler requires a function which takes a parameter of type `MouseEvent`. The handler can then decide what kind of message should be sent to the component. This message is scheduled for the next update loop unconditionally.

If you need a callback that might not need to cause an update, use `batch_callback`.

```rust
use yew::{events::KeyboardEvent, html, Component, Context, Html};

enum Msg {
    Submit,
}

struct Comp;

impl Component for Comp {

    type Message = Msg;
    type Properties = ();

    fn create(_ctx: &Context<Self>) -> Self {
        Self
    }

    fn view(&self, ctx: &Context<Self>) -> Html {
        // highlight-start
        let onkeypress = ctx.link().batch_callback(|event: KeyboardEvent| {
            if event.key() == "Enter" {
                Some(Msg::Submit)
            } else {
                None
            }
        });

        html! {
            <input type="text" {onkeypress} />
        }
        // highlight-end
    }
}
```
