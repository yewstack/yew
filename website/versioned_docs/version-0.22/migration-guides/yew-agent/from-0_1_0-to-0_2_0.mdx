## Removal of `Context` and `Job` Agents

The `Context` and `Job` Agents have been removed in favour of Yew's Context API.

You can see the updated [`pub_sub`](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/tree/master/examples/pub_sub)
which demonstrate how to use the context API.

For users of `yew_agent::utils::store`, you may switch to third party solutions like: [Yewdux](https://github.com/intendednull/yewdux) or [Bounce](https://github.com/futursolo/bounce).

## `Threaded` has been separated into `PublicAgent` and `PrivateAgent`

Replace `use yew_agent::Threaded;` with `use yew_agent::PublicAgent;`.

:::note

`Threaded` was never implemented for Private Agents.
All existing web worker-based agents are Public Agents.
