The `ref` keyword can be used inside of any HTML element or component to get the DOM `Element` that
the item is attached to. This can be used to make changes to the DOM outside of the `view` lifecycle
method.

This is useful for getting ahold of canvas elements, or scrolling to different sections of a page.

## Example

See [use_node_ref hook](./hooks/use-node-ref)
