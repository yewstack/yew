title: 'Pure Components'

## Pure function definition

A function is considered pure when the return values are deterministic given the same parameters, and it has no side-effects.

## Pure components

In the same sense component is pure when it does not have any state or side_effects and with the given props always returns the same `Html`.

For example below is a pure component, for a given prop `is_loading` it will always result in same `Html` without any side effects.

```rust
use yew::{Properties, function_component, Html, html};

#[derive(Properties, PartialEq)]
pub struct Props {
    pub is_loading: bool,
}

#[function_component]
fn HelloWorld(props: &Props) -> Html {
    if props.is_loading.clone() {
        html! { "Loading" }
    } else {
        html! { "Hello world" }
    }
}
```

## Un-pure components

Though you probably wonder how can a component even be un-pure if its just a function that is called every render and if it does not use any globals.
This is where the next topic comes in - [hooks](./hooks)
