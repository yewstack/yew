title: 'Pure Components'
---

A function component is considered [pure] when the returned `Html` is deterministically derived
from its props, and its view function mutates no state or has other side-effects.

[pure]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function

For example below is a pure component. For a given prop `is_loading` it will always result in the same `Html` without any side effects.

```rust
use yew::{Properties, function_component, Html, html};

#[derive(Properties, PartialEq)]
pub struct Props {
    pub is_loading: bool,
}

#[function_component]
fn HelloWorld(props: &Props) -> Html {
    if props.is_loading {
        html! { "Loading" }
    } else {
        html! { "Hello world" }
    }
}
```

## Un-pure components

You might wonder if a component can be un-pure if it does not use any globals, since its just a function that is called every render.
