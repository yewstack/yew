title: 'use_force_update'

`use_force_update` is a low-level hook specialized to triggering a re-render of a function component.
Usually, this re-render is triggered automatically by the hook holding your data, for example when
changing the data in a handle returned from [`use_state`](./use-state).

::: caution

Often, using this hook means you are doing something wrong and should use one of the other hooks,
for example [`use_reducer`](./use-reducer) is a great way to track changing data.

:::

Use this hook when wrapping an API that doesn't expose precise subscription events for fetched data.
You could then, at some point, invalidate your local cache of the fetched data and trigger a re-render
to let the normal render flow of components tell you again which data to fetch, and repopulate the
cache accordingly.
