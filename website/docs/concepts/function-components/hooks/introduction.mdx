## Hooks

Hooks are functions that let you store state and perform side-effects.

Yew comes with a few pre-defined Hooks. You can also create your own or discover many [community made hooks](/community/awesome#hooks).

## Rules of hooks

1. A hook function name always has to start with `use_`
2. Hooks can only be used in the following locations:
    - Top level of a function / hook.
    - Blocks inside a function / hook, given it's not already branched.
    - In the condition of a top level `if` expression inside a function / hook.
    - In the scrutinee of a top level `match` expression inside a function / hook.
3. Hooks must be called in the same order for every render. Returning early is only allowed when using [Suspense](../../suspense.mdx)

These rules are enforced by either compile time or run-time errors.

### Pre-defined Hooks

Yew comes with the following predefined Hooks:

-   [`use_state`](./use-state.mdx)
-   [`use_state_eq`](./use-state.mdx#use_state_eq)
-   [`use_memo`](./use-memo.mdx)
-   [`use_callback`](./use-callback.mdx)
-   [`use_mut_ref`](./use-mut-ref.mdx)
-   [`use_node_ref`](./use-node-ref.mdx)
-   [`use_reducer`](./use-reducer.mdx)
-   [`use_reducer_eq`](./use-reducer.mdx#use_reducer_eq)
-   [`use_effect`](./use-effect.mdx)
-   [`use_effect_with_deps`](./use-effect.mdx#use_effect_with_deps)
-   [`use_context`](./use-context.mdx)
-   [`use_force_update`](./use-force-update.mdx)

### Custom Hooks

There are cases where you want to define your own Hooks to encapsulate potentially stateful logic from a component into reusable functions.
See the [Defining custom hooks](concepts/function-components/hooks/custom-hooks.mdx#defining-custom-hooks) section for more information.

## Further reading

-   The React documentation has a section on [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
    These are not exactly the same as Yew's hooks, but the underlying concept is similar.
