## Hooks

Hooks are functions that let you store state and perform side-effects.

Yew comes with a few pre-defined Hooks. You can also create your own or discover many [community made hooks](/community/awesome#hooks).

## Rules of hooks

1. A hook function name always has to start with `use_`
2. Hooks can only be used at the following locations:
    - Top level of a function / hook.
    - If condition inside a function / hook, given it's not already branched.
    - Match condition inside a function / hook, given it's not already branched.
    - Blocks inside a function / hook, given it's not already branched.
3. Hooks every render must be called in the same order

All these rules are enforced by either compile time or run-time errors.

### Pre-defined Hooks

Yew comes with the following predefined Hooks:

-   [`use_state`](./use-state.mdx)
-   [`use_state_eq`](./use-state.mdx#use_state_eq)
-   [`use_memo`](./use-memo.mdx)
-   [`use_callback`](./use-callback.mdx)
-   [`use_mut_ref`](./use-mut-ref.mdx)
-   [`use_node_ref`](./use-node-ref.mdx)
-   [`use_reducer`](./use-reducer.mdx)
-   [`use_reducer_eq`](./use-reducer.mdx#use_reducer_eq)
-   [`use_effect`](./use-effect.mdx)
-   [`use_effect_with_deps`](./use-effect.mdx#use_effect_with_deps)
-   [`use_context`](./use-context.mdx)

### Custom Hooks

There are cases where you want to define your own Hooks for reasons. Yew allows you to define your own Hooks which lets you extract your potentially stateful logic from the component into reusable functions.
See the [Defining custom hooks](./custom-hooks.mdx#defining-custom-hooks) section for more information.

## Further reading

-   The React documentation has a section on [React hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).
    These are not exactly the same as Yew's hooks, but the underlying concept is similar.
