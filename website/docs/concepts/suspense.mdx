Suspense is a way to suspend component rendering whilst waiting a task
to complete and a fallback (placeholder) UI is shown in the meanwhile.

It can be used to fetch data from server, wait for tasks to be completed
by an agent, or perform other background asynchronous task.

Before suspense, data fetching usually happens after (Fetch-on-render) or before
component rendering (Fetch-then-render).

### Render-as-You-Fetch

Suspense enables a new approach that allows components to initiate data request
during the rendering process. When a component initiates a data request,
the rendering process will become suspended and a fallback UI will be
shown until the request is completed.

The recommended way to use suspense is with hooks.

```rust ,ignore
use yew::prelude::*;

#[function_component(Content)]
fn content() -> HtmlResult {
    let user = use_user()?;

    Ok(html! {<div>{"Hello, "}{&user.name}</div>})
}

#[function_component(App)]
fn app() -> Html {
    let fallback = html! {<div>{"Loading..."}</div>};

    html! {
        <Suspense {fallback}>
            <Content />
        </Suspense>
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `use_user` hook will suspend the component
rendering while user information is loading and a `Loading...` placeholder will
be shown until `user` is loaded.

To define a hook that suspends a component rendering, it needs to return
a `SuspensionResult<T>`. When the component needs to be suspended, the
hook should return a `Err(Suspension)` and users should unwrap it with
`?` in which it will be converted into `Html`.

```rust ,ignore
use yew::prelude::*;
use yew::suspense::{Suspension, SuspensionResult};

struct User {
    name: String,
}

#[hook]
fn use_user() -> SuspensionResult<User> {
    match load_user() {
        // If a user is loaded, then we return it as Ok(user).
        Some(m) => Ok(m),
        None => {
            // When user is still loading, then we create a `Suspension`
            // and call `SuspensionHandle::resume` when data loading
            // completes, the component will be re-rendered
            // automatically.
            let (s, handle) = Suspension::new();
            on_load_user_complete(move || {handle.resume();});
            Err(s)
        },
    }
}
```

#### Note on implementing suspending hooks

[`Suspension::new`](https://docs.rs/yew/latest/yew/suspense/struct.Suspension.html#method.new) returns 2 values: the suspension context itself, and a suspension handle.
The latter is the one responsible for signaling when to re-render the suspended components, it provides 2 interchangeable ways to do so:

1. Calling its [`resume`](https://docs.rs/yew/latest/yew/suspense/struct.SuspensionHandle.html#method.resume) method.
2. Dropping the handle.

:::danger

The suspension handle must be stored until it's time to update components, i.e. with newly received data;
otherwise, the suspended components will enter an infinite re-render loop, thus hampering performance.
In the example above, the suspension handle is preserved by being moved into a closure and passed into `on_load_user_complete`.
When the hypothetical user will be loaded, the closure will be called, thus calling `handle.resume()` and re-rendering the components associated with the suspension context.

# Complete Example

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;
use yew::suspense::{Suspension, SuspensionResult};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct User {
    name: String,
}

fn load_user() -> Option<User> {
    todo!()  // implementation omitted.
}

fn on_load_user_complete<F: FnOnce()>(_fn: F) {
    todo!()  // implementation omitted.
}

#[hook]
fn use_user() -> SuspensionResult<User> {
    match load_user() {
        // If a user is loaded, then we return it as Ok(user).
        Some(m) => Ok(m),
        None => {
            // When user is still loading, then we create a `Suspension`
            // and call `SuspensionHandle::resume` when data loading
            // completes, the component will be re-rendered
            // automatically.
            let (s, handle) = Suspension::new();
            on_load_user_complete(move || {handle.resume();});
            Err(s)
        },
    }
}

#[function_component(Content)]
fn content() -> HtmlResult {
    let user = use_user()?;

    Ok(html! {<div>{"Hello, "}{&user.name}</div>})
}

#[function_component(App)]
fn app() -> Html {
    let fallback = html! {<div>{"Loading..."}</div>};

    html! {
        <Suspense {fallback}>
            <Content />
        </Suspense>
    }
}
```

### Use Suspense in Struct Components

It's not possible to suspend a struct component directly. However, you
can use a function component as a [Higher Order Component](../advanced-topics/struct-components/hoc)
to achieve suspense-based data fetching.

The [suspense example in the Yew repository](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/tree/master/examples/suspense/src/struct_consumer.rs)
demonstrates how to use.
