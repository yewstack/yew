As of today, WebAssembly is not feature-complete for DOM interactions. This means even in Yew we
sometimes rely on calling JavaScript. What follows is an overview of the involved libraries.

## wasm-bindgen

[`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) is a library and tool that bridges calls between JavaScript and Rust functions.

We highly recommend you take a look at their [documentation](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/) and our [quick guide](./wasm-bindgen.mdx).

## web-sys

The [`web-sys` crate](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys) provides bindings for Web APIs and allows us to write JavaScript code in a rustyfied and safe way.

Example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JS" label="JS">

```js
let document = window.document
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="RS" label="RS">

```rust ,no_run
use wasm_bindgen::UnwrapThrowExt;
use web_sys::window;

let document = window()
    .expect_throw("window is undefined")
    .document()
    .expect_throw("document is undefined");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once again we highly recommend you take a look at their [documentation](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/) and our [quick guide](./web-sys.mdx).
