Sadly as of today WebAssembly is not feature-complete for DOM interations. This means even in Yew we sometimes rely on calling Javascript.

## wasm-bindgen

[`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) is a library and tool that allows to call javascript from rust and rust from javascript.

We highly recommend you give a look to their [documentation](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/)

We will also expand upon this concept in the [more wasm-bindgen](../wasm-bindgen).

## web-sys

The [`web-sys` crate](https://crates.io/crates/web-sys) provides bindings for Web APIs and allows us to write Javascript code in a rustyfied and safe way.

Example:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="JS" label="JS">

```js
let document = window.document;
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="RS" label="RS">

```rust ,no_run
use wasm_bindgen::UnwrapThrowExt;
use web_sys::window;

let document = window()
    .expect_throw("window is undefined")
    .document()
    .expect_throw("document is undefined");
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once again we highly recommend you give a look to their [documentation](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/)

We will also expand upon this concept in the [more wasm-bindgen](../wasm-bindgen).
