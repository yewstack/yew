For HTML we achieve this by providing the `html!` macro:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

let my_header: Html = html!{<img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600" />};
```

`html!` macro allows you to write html generation as if it was in a `.html` file and then behind the scenes by yew gets turned into internal builder patterns that generate all DOM nodes.

As it is part of rust code it provides a easy way to switch from html to rust by applying curly brackets:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

let header_text = "Hello world".to_string();
let header_html: Html = html!{<h1>{header_text}</h1>};

let count: usize = 5;
let counter_html: Html = html!{<p>{"My age is: "}{count}</p>};

let combined_html: Html = html!{<div>{header_html}{counter_html}</div>};
```

One rule major rule comes with use of `html!` - you can only return 1 wrapping node:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Valid" label="Valid">

```rust
use yew::html;

html! {
    <div>
        <div></div>
        <p></p>
    </div>
};

```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Invalid" label="Invalid">

```rust, compile_fail
use yew::html;

// error: only one root html element allowed

html! {
    <div></div>
    <p></p>
};

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To help with this rule and avoid `div` abuse `html!` allows fragments. Fragments are empty tags that do not provide any html result:

```rust
use yew::html;

html! {
    <>
        <div></div>
        <p></p>
    </>
};

```

We will introduce Yew and HTML further in depth in [more HTML](../html).
