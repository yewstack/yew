For HTML we achieve this by providing the `html!` macro:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

let my_header: Html = html!{
    <img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600" />
};
```

The `html!` macro allows you to write html generation as if it was in a `.html` file and
behind the scenes yew turns it into a rust expression representing the DOM to generate.

Similar to format expressions, there is an easy way to embed values from the surrounding
context into the html by applying curly brackets:

```rust
use yew::prelude::*;

let header_text = "Hello world".to_string();
let header_html: Html = html!{
    <h1>{header_text}</h1>
};

let count: usize = 5;
let counter_html: Html = html!{
    <p>{"My age is: "}{count}</p>
};

let combined_html: Html = html!{
    <div>{header_html}{counter_html}</div>
};
```

One rule major rule comes with use of `html!` - you can only return 1 wrapping node.
To render a list of multiple elements, `html!` allows fragments. Fragments are tags
without a name, that produce no html element by themselves.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Invalid" label="Invalid">

```rust , compile_fail
use yew::html;

// error: only one root html element allowed
html! {

    <div></div>
    <p></p>

};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Valid" label="Valid">

```rust
use yew::html;

// fixed: using html fragments
html! {
    <>
        <div></div>
        <p></p>
    </>
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

We will introduce Yew and HTML further in depth in [more HTML](concepts/html/introduction.mdx).
