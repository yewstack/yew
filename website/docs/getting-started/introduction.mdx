title: 'Getting Started'
---

You will need a couple of tools to compile, build, package and debug your Yew application.
When getting started, we recommend using [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/). Trunk is a WASM web application
bundler for Rust.

## Installing Rust

To install Rust, follow the [official instructions](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

:::important
The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) for Yew is `1.56.1`. Older versions can cause unexpected
issues accompanied by incomprehensible error messages. You can check your toolchain version using
`rustup show` (under "active toolchain") or alternatively `rustc --version`. To update your
toolchain, run `rustup update`.

## Install WebAssembly target

Rust can compile source codes for different "targets" (e.g. different processors). The compilation
target for browser-based WebAssembly is called `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. The following command will
add the WebAssembly target to your development environment.

```shell
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Install Trunk

Trunk is the recommended tool for managing deployment and packaging, and is used throughout the
documentation and examples.

```shell
# note that this might take a while to install, because it compiles everything from scratch
# Trunk also provides prebuilt binaries for a number of major package managers
# See https://trunkrs.dev/#install for further details
cargo install --locked trunk
```

### Other options

There are options other than Trunk that may be used for bundling Yew applications. You might want to try one of these options:

-   [`wasm-pack`](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/)
-   [`wasm-run`](https://github.com/IMI-eRnD-Be/wasm-run)
-   [`xtask-wasm`](https://github.com/rustminded/xtask-wasm/) (still in early development)

## Next steps

With your development environment setup, you can now either proceed with the reading the documentation.
