## Using a starter template

Once you have the environment ready, you can use the starter template to create the boilerplate needed for a basic Yew app.

Install [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate) by following their installation instructions
then run the following command:

```shell
cargo generate --git https://github.com/yewstack/yew-trunk-minimal-template
```

## Setting up the application manually

### Create Project

To get started, create a new cargo project.

```bash
cargo new yew-app
```

Open the newly created directory.

```bash
cd yew-app
```

### Run a hello world example

To verify the Rust environment is setup, run the initial project using the cargo build tool. After output about the build process, you should see the expected "Hello World" message.

```bash
cargo run
```

### Converting the project into a Yew web application

To convert this simple command line application to a basic Yew web application, a few changes are needed.

#### Update Cargo.toml

Add `yew` to the list of dependencies.

```toml title=Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "yew-app"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
# you can check the latest version here: https://crates.io/crates/yew
yew = "0.19"
```

#### Update main.rs

We need to generate a template which sets up a root Component called `App` which renders a button that updates its value when clicked.
Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following code.

:::note
The line `yew::start_app::<App>()` inside `main()` starts your application and mounts it to the page's `<body>` tag.
If you would like to start your application with any dynamic properties, you can instead use `yew::start_app_with_props::<App>(..)`.
:::

```rust ,no_run, title=main.rs
use yew::prelude::*;

#[function_component]
fn App() -> Html {
    let counter = use_state(|| 0);
    let onclick = {
        let counter = counter.clone();
        move |_| {
            let value = *counter + 1;
            counter.set(value);
        }
    };

    html! {
        <div>
            <button {onclick}>{ "+1" }</button>
            <p>{ *counter }</p>
        </div>
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::start_app::<App>();
}
```

#### Create index.html

Finally, add an `index.html` file in the root directory of your app.

```html , title=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <title>Yew App</title>
  </head>
</html>
```

## View your web application

Run the following command to build and serve the application locally.

```bash
trunk serve
```

Trunk will helpfully rebuild your application if you modify any of its files.

## Congratulations

You have now successfully setup your Yew development environment, and built your first web application.

Experiment with this application and review the [examples](./examples.mdx) to further your learning.
