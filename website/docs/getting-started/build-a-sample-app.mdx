title: 'Build a sample app'
---

Once you have the environment ready, you can either choose to use a starter template that contains
the boilerplate needed for a basic Yew app or manually set up a small project.

## Using a starter template

Install [`cargo-generate`](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate) by following their installation instructions
then run the following command:

```shell
cargo generate --git https://github.com/yewstack/yew-trunk-minimal-template
```

## Setting up the application manually

### Create Project

To get started, create a new cargo project.

```bash
cargo new yew-app
```

Open the newly created directory.

```bash
cd yew-app
```

### Run a hello world example

To verify the Rust environment is set up, run the initial project using `cargo run`. You should see
a "Hello World!" message.

```bash
cargo run
# output: Hello World!
```

### Setting up the project as a Yew web application

To convert this simple command line application to a basic Yew web application, a few changes are needed.

#### Update Cargo.toml

Add `yew` to the list of dependencies.

```toml title=Cargo.toml
[package]
name = "yew-app"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
# this is the development version of Yew
yew = { git = "https://github.com/yewstack/yew/", features = ["csr"] }
```

:::info

You only need the feature `csr` if you are building an application.
It will enable the `Renderer` and all client-side rendering-related code.

If you are making a library, do not enable this feature as it will pull in
client-side rendering logic into the server-side rendering bundle.

If you need the Renderer for testing or examples, you should enable it
in the `dev-dependencies` instead.

:::

#### Update main.rs

We need to generate a template that sets up a root Component called `App` which renders a button
that updates its value when clicked. Replace the contents of `src/main.rs` with the following code.

:::note
The call to `yew::Renderer::<App>::new().render()` inside the `main` function starts your application and mounts
it to the page's `<body>` tag. If you would like to start your application with any dynamic
properties, you can instead use `yew::Renderer::<App>::with_props(..).render()`.
:::

```rust ,no_run, title=main.rs
use yew::prelude::*;

#[function_component]
fn App() -> Html {
    let counter = use_state(|| 0);
    let onclick = {
        let counter = counter.clone();
        move |_| {
            let value = *counter + 1;
            counter.set(value);
        }
    };

    html! {
        <div>
            <button {onclick}>{ "+1" }</button>
            <p>{ *counter }</p>
        </div>
    }
}

fn main() {
    yew::Renderer::<App>::new().render();
}
```

#### Create index.html

Finally, add an `index.html` file in the root directory of your app.

```html , title=index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>Yew App</title>
    </head>
</html>
```

## View your web application

Run the following command to build and serve the application locally.

```bash
trunk serve
```

Trunk will rebuild your application if you modify any of its source code files.

## Congratulations

You have now successfully set up your Yew development environment, and built your first web application.

Experiment with this application and review the [examples](./examples.mdx) to further your learning.
