:::info
We're working on making it easy to test components, but this is currently a work in progress.

Support for [shallow rendering](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/issues/1413) can be found in the GitHub repository.

## Snapshot testing

Yew exposes the `yew::tests::layout_tests` module to facilitate with snapshot testing of components.

## wasm_bindgen_test

The Rust/WASM working group maintains a crate called [`wasm_bindgen_test`](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/wasm-bindgen-test/index.html)
which allows you to run tests in a browser in similar fashion to how the built-in `#[test]` procedural macro works.
More information is given in the [Rust Wasm working group's documentation](https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/wasm-bindgen/wasm-bindgen-test/index.html)
for this module.
