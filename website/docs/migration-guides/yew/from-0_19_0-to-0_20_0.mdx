## `_as_body` variant of `start_app` is removed

This method of controlling body has caused issues in event registration and
SSR hydration. They have been removed. Read more in the [github issue](https://github.com/yewstack/yew/pull/2346).

## New Hooks and Function Components API

The Function Components and Hooks API are re-implemented with a different mechanism:

- User-defined hooks are now required to have a prefix `use_` and must be marked with the `#[hook]` attribute.
- Hooks will now report compile errors if they are not called from the top level of a function component
  or a user defined hook. The limitation existed in the previous version of Yew as well. In this version,
  It is reported as a compile time error.
