## MSRV raised to 1.84.0

The minimum supported Rust version is now **1.84.0**. Update your toolchain:

```bash
rustup update stable
```

## gloo-worker vendored

The external dependency on `gloo-worker` has been removed. All worker functionality is now built into `yew-agent`.

### Update imports

If you were importing types from `gloo-worker`, update to import from `yew_agent`:

```rust ,ignore
// Before
use gloo_worker::{Spawnable, Worker, WorkerScope};

// After
use yew_agent::prelude::*;
// or
use yew_agent::{Spawnable, Worker, WorkerScope};
```

### Codec trait

The `Codec` trait is now defined in `yew-agent`:

```rust ,ignore
// Before
use gloo_worker::Codec;

// After
use yew_agent::Codec;
```
