## What is a portal?

Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component.
The `<Portal />` component renders its `children` into the `host` element provided in its properties.

## Usage

Typical uses of portals can include modal dialogs and hovercards, as well as more technical applications
such as controlling the contents of an element's
[`shadowRoot`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/shadowRoot), appending
stylesheets to the surrounding document's `<head>` and collecting referenced elements inside a
central `<defs>` element of an `<svg>`.

# Example

This example implements a simple modal dialogue that renders its `children`
into an element outside `yew`'s control,
identified by the `id="modal_host"`.

```rust
use yew::{html, function_component, Children, Properties, Html};
use yew::portal::Portal;

#[derive(Properties, PartialEq)]
pub struct ModalProps {
    #[prop_or_default]
    pub children: Children,
}

#[function_component(Modal)]
fn modal(props: &ModalProps) -> Html {
    let modal_host = gloo::utils::document()
        .get_element_by_id("modal_host")
        .expect("a #modal_host element");

    html! {
        <Portal host={modal_host}>
            { for props.children.iter() }
        </Portal>
    }
}
```
