## What are Components?

Components are the building blocks of Yew. They manage their own state and can render themselves to the DOM.
Components are created by implementing the `Component` trait for a type.

## Writing Component's markup

Yew uses Virtual DOM to render elements to the DOM. The Virtual DOM tree can be constructed by using the
`html!` macro. `html!` uses syntax which is similar to HTML but is not exactly the same. The rules are also
much stricter. It also provides super-powers like conditional rendering and rendering of lists using iterators.

## Passing data to a component

Yew components use _props_ to communicate between parent and children. A parent component may pass any data as props to
its children. Props are similar to HTML attributes but any Rust type can be passed as props.
