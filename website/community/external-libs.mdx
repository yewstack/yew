## Malvolio

[Malvolio](https://crates.io/crates/malvolio) is a library with a "builder-syntax" for creating complex HTML documents
with ease. It runs both on servers (and renders to strings) or in browsers (with Yew).

## Weblog

[weblog](https://crates.io/crates/weblog) is a crate that defines a set of macros for calling `console.log()`,
`console.error()` and other members of the browser's console API when targeting WASM.

## Gloo

[Gloo](https://crates.io/crates/gloo) is a modular toolkit for building fast, reliable Web applications and
libraries with Rust and Wasm. Gloo provides ergonomic Rust APIs for working with:

-   [Console timers](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-console-timer)
-   [Dialogs](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-dialogs)
-   [Events](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-events)
-   [Files](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-file)
-   [Requests](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-net)
-   [Timers](https://crates.io/crates/gloo-timers)
